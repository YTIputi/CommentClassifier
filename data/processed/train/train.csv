i think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself in your death bed every now and then to prepare yourself for this you must read the 9th chapter of the death of ivan ilyich again just a very short chapter where ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed he suddenly hears the voice of his own soul saying what do you want what do you want he says what do i want to live and not to suffer so his inner voice says to live how to live as i used to well and pleasantly as you lived before well and pleasantly here is how tolstoy continues and in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life but strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except the first recollections of childhood there in childhood there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return but the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else as soon as the period began which had produced the present ivan ilyich all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty so as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and darker he basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statushe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no way back indeed we all must keep ivan ilyich in mind every day just consider how fast the time goes by how much of it do we really spend seriously thinking about our lives very little indeed because it requires a certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time thats why this scene is a great reminder so as we make the death bed exercise i have just mentioned we can use the very questions that ivan ilyichs soul was asking him i think people who live well deal with their mortality better so doing this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better thank you for this wonderful lesson i love tolstoy,False,True,False

i love this guys videos and have been watching since 2018 but its unfortunate how they focused on iphones strong points and left out some of androids strong points as well its also extremely unfair to make this video android vs ios because ios is just on iphones while android is on several phones some astonishing some horrible they shouldve picked a battle like samsung android vs apple ios it should of been a fair fight but it sadly wasnt i also dont like how they left out a lot of androids features like usbc newer technology and tricks and features like quad hd displays that perform amazing very unfortunate and disappointing to see mrwhosetheboos and marques do it like this felt very bias and unfair to keep going further arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while marques was on here he was more accepting and less opposing to him showing bias as he is a fan of mkbhd to keep going even further they also stretched out points in favour for apple by a lot like the software support which yes apple has facetime imessage and more samsung and android are greatly improving their technology and google message is to apples level too i feel like this video shouldve had an as wide focus on androids features then it did with iphone features great videos but im very disappointed unfortunately and this comes from someone who used iphone and android for years final thoughts this was very bias towards apple this video shouldve not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it this video was a comparison on sole facts so dont stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other this was expected with marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with apple which grows his bias towards them immensely and that is undeniable fact,True,False,False

theres a lot more unusual stuff under the hood of these guys and their echidna cousins their skeletons for example have epipubic bones aka pouch bones which are only found in marsupials and monotremes but more unusual still they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle while all other mammals have only two on a human for example the pectoral girdle aka the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum it means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket compare this to birdsreptiles and older tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum this third bone is the coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in monotremes on the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig splayed legs more ribs than other mammals low body heat eggs venom etc honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointynosed hedgehog,False,True,False

thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,False,False,True

my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,True,False,False
