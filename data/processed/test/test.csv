my sons were in chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively i am french and their mom and chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system until the 6th grade the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work now as bicultural kids they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son from 6th grade onwards the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave bullying by teachers can also occur my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates this 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden what it didnt do is address some fundamental issues with the system teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students instead they push them out everything is based on 2 tests one in grade 9 and one in grade 12 these tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills even if that has improved a bit system should be reformed to take equivalent of gpa into account this would ease a lot of the pressure the last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow there is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education yes most of them will have strong language and math skills but a lot of it is mechanical some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum,False,True,False

germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy their co2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence personally i am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer but without the emissions renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclearfossil fuels i would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants using the same small plots of land with renewable it requires covering vast amounts of land with solarwind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is windsolar this land should be used for farming or nature preserves not renewables if the solar is using worthless land such as the desert maybe it makes senses but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaningmaintenance needed due to the dust offshore wind also resolves the land use problem but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties,False,True,False

my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,True,False,False
